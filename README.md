# PCDMs
Implementation code：[Advancing Pose-Guided Image Synthesis with Progressive Conditional Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06313.pdf), accepted at International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2024.


**[Note!!!]:** We have released a simplified version of PCDMs, using only stage 2, and trained with data from TikTok and DeepFashion to test the model's generalization capability. 
However, due to limited computational power and data, the results are not very stable. Therefore, this is an experimental version.
The weights can be obtained from [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hnPm-GzaAtQKjgG_glhlQZieJ5g5Xd-y?usp=drive_link).

You can directly download our test results from Google Drive: (1) [PCDMs vs SOTA](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1q21tA3VsQqScecQ7m3_eUFxIPWUGYKAa?usp=drive_link) (2) [PCDMs Results](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sjqMhZ79pugk2IHhW-whg_NASpx3BSew?usp=drive_link).

The [PCDMs vs SOTA](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1q21tA3VsQqScecQ7m3_eUFxIPWUGYKAa?usp=drive_link) compares our method with several state-of-the-art methods e.g. ADGAN, PISE, GFLA, DPTN, CASD, NTED, PIDM. 
Each row contains target_pose, source_image, ground_truth, ADGAN, PISE, GFLA, DPTN, CASD, NTED, PIDM, and PCDMs (ours) respectively.

## Dataset
### Processed Data
This [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17yqf2iV2y7Hwx-__uV_-cRaOm2XX8lWS?usp=drive_link) contains processed and prepared data that is ready for use.
The data has been processed in the following ways:

&#8226; Rename image

&#8226; Split the train/test set

&#8226; keypoints extracted with Openpose

The folder structure of dataset should be as follows:

```
